# Apache Kafka (KRaft Mode) Enterprise Microservices Platform with Kubernetes (Kind)

## Project Overview

CThis repository demonstrates a production-grade, enterprise-level event-driven microservices architecture built using:

- [x] Apache Kafka (KRaft mode, no Zookeeper)

- [x] Python microservices (Producers & Consumers)

- [x] Docker (containerized services)

- [x] Kubernetes (orchestration, scaling, resilience)

##### The system models a real-world enterprise workflow consisting of Orders, Payments, and Shipping domains communicating asynchronously via Kafka topics.

##### Each domain is implemented as a fully independent microservice, deployed and orchestrated using Kubernetes.
